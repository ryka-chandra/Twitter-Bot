# Twitter-Bot
AI that generates (somewhat) realistic tweets

## Overview

This project involves creating a TwitterBot that generates realistic tweets using a Markov Chain model. The bot is trained on real Twitter data, which is read from CSV files, cleaned, and then processed to produce new tweet-like text.

## Features

- **Data Parsing**: Extracts tweets from CSV files using a custom file iterator.
- **Data Cleaning**: Filters out unnecessary content, such as URLs, to improve the quality of the training data.
- **Markov Chain Implementation**: Analyzes the sequence of words in the tweets to generate new text.
- **Tweet Generation**: Combines all components to produce realistic tweets based on the training data.

## Project Structure

- **FileLineIterator.java**: Reads tweet data line by line from CSV files.
- **TweetParser.java**: Cleans and formats the raw tweet data for better model performance.
- **MarkovChain.java**: Implements the Markov Chain, storing word pairs and their frequencies.
- **TwitterBot.java**: Integrates the Markov Chain with the cleaned tweet data to generate new tweets.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Tweets are read from CSV files using `FileLineIterator`.
2. **Data Cleaning**: `TweetParser` removes unwanted content and structures the data for training.
3. **Markov Chain Training**: `MarkovChain` learns word sequences from the cleaned tweets.
4. **Tweet Generation**: The bot uses the trained Markov Chain to create new tweets by selecting words based on learned probabilities.

## Usage

- **Training the Bot**: The bot is trained on the tweet data present in the CSV files located in the `files` directory.
- **Generating Tweets**: Run the `TwitterBot` class to generate new tweets based on the trained Markov Chain model.

## Examples

Here are some examples of tweets generated by the bot:

- "Just finished my coffee, time to start the day with some code!"
- "Can't believe how fast the weekend went by, back to work tomorrow."

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Cleaning**: Implement more sophisticated text processing to handle emojis, hashtags, and mentions.
- **Advanced Models**: Explore more complex models beyond Markov Chains, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
- **User Interface**: Create a simple web interface where users can interact with the bot and generate tweets on demand.
